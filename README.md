This is the collective repository of where all of my experiments will be going from now on. Whether they fail or succeed.
I just prefer to test things out separately from the main project of where I'd like something to go into so I don't end up
with a complete mess that I have to sort out if things don't work out the way I'd like. Other times, it's just nothing more
than me learning how something works with no real goal in mind.

But the primary purpose of this repository is to prevent my Git-Hub account page from being cluttered up with my nonsense.

That's it. Feel free to look through here if you'd like. If something doesn't work, I will make a note of it for you in 
a README file.
